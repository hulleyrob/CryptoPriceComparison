# CryptoPriceComparison

Inspired by what i saw at https://itnext.io/create-beautiful-cryptocurrency-graphs-in-python-bec7b9cbc21a

I created this to do a relative comparison between coins that im interested in.

Maybe this can be useful for someone else looking to do the same.

To use you will need to:
pip install pandas
pip install pandas_datareader
pip install plotly
pip install sklearn

Edit the CRYPTOS list for the coins your interested in (use https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies/ for the correct names less the currency)

Once its finished getting the data it will open your default browser with an interactive graph.

Enjoy.
